```{python}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import numpy as np

from IPython.display import Markdown
from IPython.display import display
from tabulate import tabulate
```


## Elevator pitch

In this assignment I demonstrated that I had the correct libraries installed and that I had a basic understanding on how to use them. 


__Highlight the grand questions__

## GRAND QUESTION 1

In VS Code, write a python script to create the example Altair chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook (part of the assigned readings). Note that you have to type chart to see the Altair chart after you create it.

My analisis for this chart is that the higher the displacement of a vehichle the lower the mile per gallon.

```{python}
#| label: GQ1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
mpg = pd.read_csv('mpg.csv')

chart = (alt.Chart(mpg)
  .encode(
    x='displ', 
    y='hwy')
  .mark_circle()
)

chart

```

## GRAND QUESTION 2

Your final report should also include the markdown table created from the following (assuming you have mpg from question 2).

My analysis from this table is that Audi A4s get at least 26mpg on the highway.

```{python}
#| label: GQ2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
print(mpg
  .head(5)
  .filter(["manufacturer", "model","year", "hwy"])
  .to_markdown(index=False))

```
